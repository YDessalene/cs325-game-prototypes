</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

I learned a lot about key bindings, animations, and sound. I was able to brush off my javascript skills. The easiest part about making it was getting all the animations down.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

No i got an image of the Smash map for my background from google. The two animation art is use was provided by a free licensing sprite website.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

the only example code I borrowed from phaser was how to make an in-game Timer from Custom-Timer, all other code was learned from the API, or the phaser tutorial. I guess the game that most closely resembles mine is Super Smash Bros, in the fact that I use a Smash Map for my background. Despite my game looking like smash though, the objetives and playstyle is very different.
