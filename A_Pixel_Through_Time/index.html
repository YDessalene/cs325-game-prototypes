<h2>A Pixel Through Time</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I made the enemy detection and movement code on my own.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It builds on top of the knowledge I gained in my previous games.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to add audio. The easiest part about this game was making my game states, since my previous game used them too.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
No, I received my game assets from the internet. The background I found on google images, and the characters from itch.io.
<ul>
<li>Character spritesheets: <a href="https://rmw-restaff.itch.io/restaff-rpg-maker-28th-birthday">RPG Maker</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I guess my game resembles most stealth games mechanic-wise. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The goal of this game is to reach the endzone without being detected by the teachers.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A fun, laid-back experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Move the character with W,A,S,D.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
running in a straight line north or south, waiting for the teacher to pass by before crossing.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Kids with fre time and nothing better to do.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
No longer than 30 seconds.
</li>

</ul>
