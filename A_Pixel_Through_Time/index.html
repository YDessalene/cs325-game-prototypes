<h2>A Pixel Through Time</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This is the first few scenes of the original rpg game I plan to make over the course of the semester
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It builds on top of the knowledge I gained in my previous games. Use of Tilemaps
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to incorporate tilemaps. The easiest part about this game was making my maps through tiled.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
No, I received my game assets from the internet. The background I found on google images, and the characters from itch.io.
<ul>
<li>Character spritesheets, Audio, Tilesets: <a href="https://rmw-restaff.itch.io/restaff-rpg-maker-28th-birthday">RPG Maker</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Being an rpg, with these graphics, I would say my game most closely resmbles the old zelda games.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The goal of this game is to restore the protagonists memories by helping the fairy queen save her children. (which is at least what I've come up with so far)
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme I picked for the first few game scenes is Escape, because the only way to "beat" the fairy queen is to escape the fight
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
the playstyle and genre of this game is a full on RPG.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A fun, laid-back experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Move the character with W,A,S,D. The path is very straight foreward and no way the player can get lost. There isn't much to the game now, but hopefully by next week I will have a proper into story
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
To complete the fairy fight, flee the battle
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is long ago when mythical creatures and magic still existed. How the protagonist ended up there will be revealed later on in the story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Kids with free time and nothing better to do.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The first couple scenes which are up take about 1-2 minutes to complete.
</li>

</ul>
